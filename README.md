# DOM-Manipulation
This repository is a collection of beginner-friendly mini projects built using Vanilla JavaScript to practice and master DOM manipulation concepts. Each project focuses on real-time interactions, dynamic content updates, and user interface logic. ðŸ’¡ These projects were created as part of my learning journey with Sheryians Coding School.
